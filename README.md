### SimNet
This repository contains scripts and notebooks used for development and
experiments presented in my master's thesis.

Each directory was used for some type of experiment:
- ```grid_search_script``` - used for grid searching neural net's architecture
- ```notebooks``` - used for various visualisations, prototypes and cross validation
- ```similarity_test``` - used for finding optimal number of pairs and length of hash.
- ```gui``` - GUI for similar/dissimilar movies search based on computed hash
